PHASE 2 WEATHER REACT APP
Problem Statement
The current problem we're addressing is the inconvenience and lack of efficiency in accessing accurate weather forecasts. Many existing weather applications are either too complex or don't provide real-time updates. Users often struggle to find a simple, user-friendly weather app that meets their needs.

Solution
Our solution is to develop a web-based weather application using React. By leveraging React's component-based architecture and flexibility, we aim to create an intuitive and efficient weather app that provides accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts.
